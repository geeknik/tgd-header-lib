#  Disabled checks:
#
#  cert-err60-cpp
#    Reports stdexcept exceptions as broken which we can't do anything about.
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-owning-memory
#    Don't want to add dependency on gsl library.
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-pro-bounds-array-to-pointer-decay
#    Limited use and many false positives including for all asserts.
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-pro-bounds-pointer-arithmetic
#    This is a low-level library, it needs to do pointer arithmetic.
#
#  fuchsia-*
#    Much too strict.
#
#  google-runtime-references
#    This is just a matter of preference. Using pointers for this means
#    there is a potential problem with nullptr.
#
#  hicpp-no-array-decay
#    Limited use and many false positives including for all asserts.
#
#  readability-implicit-bool-conversion
#    I don't think this makes the code more readable.
